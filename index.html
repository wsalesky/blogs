            <h2>What is Syriac?</h2>
            <p>Syriac is a language which once flourished on the Mesopotamian plateau. A dialect of
                Aramaic, Syriac was widely used during much of the first millenium of the common
                era. Syriac speaking communities could be found in what today would be Turkey,
                Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Iran, India, Central Asia, China, and Mongolia. Sources in
                Syriac hold immense value for increasing our historical understanding of the
                Mediterranean, the Middle East and Asia. In particular, Syriac sources document key
                moments in the development and interaction of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and
                other religions of Late Antiquity. <a href="about-syriac.html">Learn more…</a>
