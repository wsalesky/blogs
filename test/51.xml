               <p>2. An excellent branch of Christian wisdom is here inculcated by our Lord on all
                  his followers, namely, the right use of money—a subject largely spoken of, after
                  their manner, <index indexName="biblical">
                     <term cRef="John15:19">by men of the world, but not sufficiently considered by
                        those whom God hath chosen out of the world</term>
                  </index>. These generally do not consider as the importance of the subject
                  requires the use of this excellent talent. Neither do they understand how to
                  employ it to the greatest advantage; the introduction of which into the world is
                  one admirable instance of the wise and gracious providence of God. It has indeed
                  been the manner of poets, orators, and philosophers, in almost all ages and
                  nations, to rail at this as the grand corrupter of the world, the bane of virtue,
                  the pest of human society. Hence nothing so commonly heard as:</p>

               <p>But is not all this mere empty rant? Is there any solid reason therein? By no
                  means. For let the world be as corrupt as it will, is gold or silver to blame?

                     <term cRef="1Tim6:10">'The love of money'</term>
                  </index>, we know, <index indexName="biblical">
                     <term cRef="1Tim6:10">'is the root of all evil'</term>
                  </index>; but not the thing itself. The fault does not lie in the money, but in
                  them that use it. It may be used ill; and what may not? But it may likewise be
                  used well; it is full as applicable to the best as to the worst uses. It is of
                  unspeakable service to all civilized nations in all the common affairs of life. It
                  is a most compendious instrument of transacting all manner of business, and (if we
                  use it according to Christian wisdom) of doing all manner of good. It is true,
                  were man in a state of innocence, or were all men 'filled with the Holy
                  Ghost', so that, like the infant church at Jerusalem, <index indexName="biblical">
                     <term cRef="Acts4:32">'no man counted anything he had his own'</term>
                  </index>, but <index indexName="biblical">
                     <term cRef="Acts4:35">'distribution was made to everyone as he had
                        need,'</term>
                  </index> the use of it would be superseded; as we cannot conceive there is
                  anything of the kind among the inhabitants of heaven. But in the present state of
                  mankind it is an excellent gift of God, answering the noblest ends. In the hands
                  of his children it is food for the hungry, drink for the thirsty, raiment for the
                  naked. It gives to the traveller and the stranger where to lay his head. By it we
                  may supply the place of an husband to the widow, and of a father to the
                  fatherless; we may be a defence for the oppressed, a means of health to the sick,
                  of ease to them that are in pain. It may be <index indexName="biblical">
                     <term cRef="Job29:15">as eyes to the blind, as feet to the lame;</term>

               <p>3. It is therefore of the highest concern that all who fear God know how to employ
                  this valuable talent; that they be instructed how it may answer these glorious
                  ends, and in the highest degree. And perhaps all the instructions which are
                  necessary for this may be reduced to three plain rules, by the exact observance
                  whereof we may approve ourselves faithful stewards of <index indexName="biblical">

                  <!--Another example of the bibl/hi problem.--> We meet them on their own ground.
                  And it is our bounden duty to do this. We ought to gain all we can gain without
                  buying gold too dear, without paying more for it than it is worth. But this it is
                  certain we ought not to do: we ought not to gain money at the expense of life; nor
                  (which is in effect the same thing) at the expense of our health. Therefore no
                  gain whatsoever should induce us to enter into, or to continue in, any employ
                  which is of such a kind, or is attended with so hard or so long labour, as to
                  impair our constitution. Neither should we begin or continue in any business which
                  necessarily deprives us of proper seasons for food and sleep in such a proportion
                  as our nature requires. Indeed there is a great difference here. Some employments
                  are absolutely and totally unhealthy—as those which imply the dealing much with
                  arsenic or other equally hurtful minerals, or the breathing an air tainted with
                  steams of melting lead, which must at length destroy the firmest constitution.
                  Others may not be absolutely unhealthy, but only to persons of a weak
                  constitution. Such are those which require many hours to be spent in writing,
                  especially if a person write sitting, and lean upon his stomach, or remain long in
                  an uneasy posture. But whatever it is which reason or experience shows to be
                  destructive of health or strength, that we may not submit to; seeing <index indexName="biblical">
                     <term cRef="Luke12:23">'the life is more' valuable 'than meat,
                        and the body than raiment.'</term>
                  </index> And if we are already engaged in such an employ, we should exchange it as
                  soon as possible for some which, if it lessen our gain, will however not lessen
                  our health.</p>
               <p>2. We are, secondly, to gain all we can without hurting our mind any more than our
                  body. For neither may we hurt this. We must preserve, at all events, the spirit of
                  an healthful mind. Therefore we may not engage or continue in any sinful trade,
                  any that is contrary to the law of God, or of our country. Such are all that
                  necessarily imply our robbing or defrauding the king of his lawful customs. <note place="foot">Cf. Wesley's prohibition in his <hi rend="italic">

                     uncustomed goods' [i.e., smuggling, etc.]. This was a serious problem in
                     Hanoverian England, especially in <placeName>Cornwall</placeName>, and Wesley
                     would have none of it.</note> For it is at least as sinful to defraud the King
                  of his right as to rob our fellow subjects. And the king has full as much right to
                  his customs as we have to our houses and apparel. Other businesses there are,
                  which however innocent <hi rend="italic">in themselves</hi>, cannot be followed
                  with innocence <hi rend="italic">now</hi> (at least, not in England): such, for
                  instance, as will not afford a competent maintenance without cheating or lying, or
                  conformity to some custom which is not consistent with a good conscience. These
                  likewise are sacredly to be avoided, whatever gain they may be attended with
                  provided we follow the custom of the trade; for to gain money we must not lose our
                  souls. There are yet others which many pursue with perfect innocence without
                  hurting either their body or mind. And yet perhaps <hi rend="italic">you</hi>
                  cannot: either they may entangle you in that company which would destroy your
                  soul—and by repeated experiments it may appear that you cannot separate the one
                  from the other—or there may be an idiosyncrasy, a peculiarity in your constitution

                  maintained without considerable expense. Cut off all this expense. Despise
                  delicacy and variety, and be content with what plain nature requires.</p>

                  gardens. Let your neighbours, who know nothing better, do this: 'Let the dead

                  of men. This motive of expense is frequently interwoven with one or both of the
                  former. Men are expensive in diet, or apparel, or furniture, not barely to please
                  their appetite, or to gratify their eye, their imagination, but their vanity too.

               <p>5. Who would expend anything in gratifying these desires if he considered that to
                  gratify them is to increase them? Nothing can be more certain than this: daily
                  experience shows, the more they are indulged, they increase the more. Whenever
                  therefore you expend anything to please your taste or other senses, you pay so
                  much for sensuality. When you lay out money to please your eye, you give so much
                  for an increase of curiosity, for a stronger attachment to these pleasures, which
                  perish in the using. While you are purchasing anything which men use to applaud,
                  you are purchasing more vanity. Had you not then enough of vanity, sensuality,
                  curiosity before? Was there need of any addition? And would you pay for it, too?
                  What manner of wisdom is this? Would not the literally throwing your money into
                  the sea be a less mischievous folly?</p>
               <p>6. And why should you throw away money upon your children, any more than upon
                  yourself, in delicate food, in gay or costly apparel, in superfluities of any
                  kind? Why should you purchase for them more pride or lust, more vanity, or <index indexName="biblical">

                  ample provision for them. Why should you be at farther expense to increase their

                  or the pride of life (at the peril of theirs and your own soul), do not set these

                  way to remove it. Calmly and seriously inquire: (1). In expending this, am I
                  acting according to my character? Am I acting herein, not as a proprietor, but as
                  a steward of my Lord's goods? (2). Am I doing this in obedience to his Word?
                  In what Scripture does he require me so to do? (3). Can I offer up this action,
                  this expense, as a sacrifice to God through Jesus Christ? (4). Have I reason to
                  believe that for this very work I shall have a reward at the resurrection of the
                  just? You will seldom need anything more to remove any doubt which arises on this

                  way wherein you should go.</p>
               <p>5. If any doubt still remain, you may farther examine yourself by prayer according
                  to those heads of inquiry. Try whether you can say to the Searcher of hearts, your
                  conscience not condemning you: 'Lord, thou seest I am going to expend this
                  sum on that food, apparel, furniture. And thou knowest I act herein with a single

                  </index>.' Now if your conscience bear you witness in the Holy Ghost that
                  this prayer is well-pleasing to God, then have you no reason to doubt but that
                  expense is right and good, and such as will never make you ashamed.</p>
               <p>6. You see then what it is to 'make [to] yourselves friends of the mammon of
                  unrighteousness', and by what means you may procure 'that when ye fail
                  they may receive you into the everlasting habitations'. You see the nature
                  and extent of truly Christian prudence so far as it relates to the use of that
                  great talent-money. <hi rend="italic">Gain all you can</hi>, without hurting
                  either yourself or your neighbour, in soul or body, by applying hereto with
                  unintermitted diligence, and with all the understanding which God has given you.
                     <hi rend="italic">Save all you can</hi>, by cutting off every expense which
                  serves only to indulge foolish desire, to gratify either the desire of the flesh,
                  the desire of the eye, or the pride of life. Waste nothing, living or dying, on
                  sin or folly, whether for yourself or your children. And then, <hi rend="italic">Give all you can</hi>, or in other words give all you have to God. Do not
                  stint yourself, like a Jew rather than a Christian, to this or that proportion.
